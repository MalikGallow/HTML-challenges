<h2>Publishing Table</h2>
<img src="http://www.incontext.indiana.edu/2005/august/images/information_table2_large.gif" alt="Publishing table" height="35%"width="35%">

    <ul>
      <li>Publishing tables mirror tables that you have identified for monitoring. They contain additional columns, primarily a sequence number and delivery status, which are required by the adapter to detect new rows. You can create a publishing table for each table that you want to activate in TIBCO Business Studio.A table is an arrangement of data in rows and columns, or possibly in a more complex structure. Tables are widely used in communication, research, and data analysis. Tables appear in print media, handwritten notes, computer software, architectural ornamentation, traffic signs, and many other places</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Periodic Table</h2>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3beunuG8tAxeCeSziLXY_fJCrAw1Ig-cy8kbIu16TyNFIokwc2A" alt="Periodic table" height="35%" width="35%">
<ul>
  <li>a table of the chemical elements arranged in order of atomic number, usually in rows, so that elements with similar atomic structure (and hence similar chemical properties) appear in vertical columns.Before all the naturally-occurring elements were discovered, the periodic table was used to predict the chemical and physical properties of elements in the gaps on the table. ... The table is useful for modern students and scientists because it helps predict the types of chemical reactions that are likely for an element</li>
</ul>

<h2>Spreadsheet</h2>

<ul>
  <li>an electronic document in which data is arranged in the rows and columns of a grid and can be manipulated and used in calculations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logic Truth Table</h2>
<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*wrRCwDAoUqHHALfHnu0Qmw.png" alt="Logic Truth Table" height="35%" width="35%">

<ul>
  <li>A truth table is a mathematical table used in logic—specifically in connection with Boolean algebra, boolean functions, and propositional calculus—which sets out the functional values of logical expressions on each of their functional arguments, that is, for each combination of values taken by their logical variables</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mathematic Table</h2>
<img src="https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/images/multiplication-table.gif" alt="Mathematic Table" height="35%" width="35%">

<ul>
  <li>Mathematical tables are lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments. Before calculators were cheap and plentiful, people would use such tables to simplify and drastically speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks</li>
</ul>
