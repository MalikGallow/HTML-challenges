  					<p>You may have heard rumblings about a recent update that wreaked havoc on a lot of “your money or your life” sites — the ones that talk about health, fitness, finances, or happiness.

               That update appeared to look at the credibility of site publishers. Are they trustworthy? Do they actually know what they’re talking about? (Google’s acronym for this authoritative trustworthiness is EAT, which makes for some really funky-sounding SEO advice.)

               Now, some approaches to SEO copywriting (like, um, the one that Copyblogger has recommended for more than a decade) will leave you in much better shape when Google goes on an EAT rampage.

               And one element that has folks scrambling? It’s the lowly — but so easy to screw up — About Page.</p>
